# TUItter.
A W.I.P twitter client that works entirely in your terminal.

## Switching to Python.
This branch is for the migration of the TUItter program to python. In order to run the program, you need to install a few libraries. 

Run:
```
pip3 install rich
pip3 install tweepy
```
in your terminal to install the required libraries.

From there, it's just a matter of running ``python3 main.py`` to run the client!
