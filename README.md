# About me (the developer)
I'm a high school student learning Java for my intro to programming class. That being said it should be obvious i'm not going to be the most active with updating this project because
1. I'm busy with schoolwork (studying, preparing for finals, etc.)
2. I'm simply just not that good at java yet.


That being said, I would be grateful if anyone proficient in java were to contribute to the project.
